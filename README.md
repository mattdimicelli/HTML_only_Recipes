## My process

### Built with
- HTML
- Markdown
- Git
- Github Hosting

### What I learned
- I focused on the importance of proper markup (since this was HTML only) and what to 
expect from browser default styles.  
- The importance of proper folder structure in website design
- Creating a README.md file was also part of the exercise, so I learned about Markdown doing this.
