    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 Tbsp. olive oil</li>
        <li>1 lb. mixed mushrooms, torn into bite-size pieces</li>
        <li>2 medium shallots, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 lb. spaghetti or similar</li>
        <li>½ cup finely chopped parsley</li>
        <li>Zest and juice of ½ lemon</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp. unsalted butter, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>½ oz. Parmesan, finely grated (about ½ cup), plus more for serving</li>
        <li>Ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 2 Tbsp. oil in a large pot over medium-high. Cook half of 
            the mushrooms in a single layer, undisturbed, until edges are brown
            and starting to crisp, about 3 minutes. Give mushrooms a toss and 
            continue to cook, tossing occasionally, until all sides are brown
            and crisp, about 5 minutes more. Using a slotted spoon, transfer 
            mushrooms to a plate; season with salt. Repeat with remaining 2 Tbsp.
            oil and mushrooms and more salt.
        </li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium-low and return all of the mushrooms to the pot.
            Add the shallots and cook, stirring often, until they are translucent
            and softened, about 2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, cook the pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water, 
            stirring occasionally, until al dente, about 2 minutes less 
            than the package directions.
        </li>
        <li>Using tongs, transfer pasta to pot with mushrooms and add cream and 
            1 cup pasta cooking liquid. Increase heat to medium, bring to a
            simmer, and cook, tossing constantly, until pasta is al dente and 
            liquid is slightly thickened, about 3 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Remove pot from heat. Add lemon zest and juice, parsley, butter, 
            ½ oz. Parmesan, and lots of pepper and toss to combine. Taste and 
            season with more salt if needed.
        </li>
        <li>Divide pasta among bowls and top with more Parmesan.</li>

    </ol>
